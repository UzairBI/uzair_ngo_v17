    excerpt: "With Jiv Daya Foundation, USA, we placed solar lanterns and charging panels in homes that have never had electricity in three forest-fringe villages of Sagar district.",
    body: [
      "In three forest-fringe tribal villages of Sagar district, not one home is connected to the power grid. After sunset, families are left in complete darkness, and in the monsoon the unpaved paths between homes become deep, slippery mud.",
      "Working with Jiv Daya Foundation (USA), our volunteers walked door-to-door, often on foot through monsoon mud, and handed more than 50 families a rechargeable solar LED lantern with a charging panel. Women can now fetch water and reach the toilet at night with light in hand, children can study after dark, and families no longer need kerosene lamps or candles.",
      "Thousands more households in Sagar district's forest belt are still waiting. Every lantern you fund gives one family safe light at no running cost. Read the full impact report, or fund a lantern from our Donate page. Light One Lamp, Change One Life."

      "The evening centres provide free tutoring and remedial classes, along with school kits and uniforms so that a child can attend without worrying about costs. Digital literacy outreach helps children become comfortable with the tools they will need later.",
      "Learning support is strongest when families and communities become part of the journey. You can sponsor a child's education or fund a school kit from our Donate page."
