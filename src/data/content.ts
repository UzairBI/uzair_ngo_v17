Women often have to fetch water or firewood after dark, many households have no in-home toilet, a sick child means finding the way with no light, and living at the forest edge brings the risk of snakes and other wildlife. With no lighting, children's study time ends at sunset.",
        "Every family received a rechargeable solar LED lantern together with a small solar charging panel: placed in daylight, the panel charges the lantern at no cost, and after dark the household has several hours of clean, reliable light inside the home and on the path outside it. Volunteer teams delivered each lantern door-to-door, often on foot through monsoon mud, and every distribution was documented with photographs."
